## Introduction  

### My CV/Portfolio

I strive to be a Front-End Developer/Web Designer/UX Designer so I tried to make this website as unique, personalized and professional as possible. It can act like a supplementary piece to my applications or any freelance work I do so anyone can see what I bring to the table. It features my resume, projects, email, behance, and linkedin, acting as my professional CV/portfolio.

My HTML and CSS are in two seperate files. I have integrated my Javascript into the HTML document in order of apperance per se. (First comes the particles.js (on load) and then navigation bar, etc.) 

## Features 

**Design**
- I created my own logo (it animates on load!)
- I wanted to create a personal brand, so I kept the design consistent between my resume (top-right) and website
- I take the littlest things into consideration. For example, giving specific text unique attributes using span. Also, fading color animations when someone hovers over a button and vice-versa. 
- I edited each h1, h2, etc. element to customize each attribute the way I wanted it to be
- I provided font-families I wanted my website to use, and backups as some browsers may not support certain fonts
- I used a specific color palette
- Simple and minimalistic, while selling myself in the best possible way

**Responsiveness**
- Mobile friendly
		- Vertical navigation bar can slide in-and-out by clicking on the menu icon and the back arrow respectively.
		- The menu also slides back out once you select a section to scroll to (user-friendly)
		- Reduced Font Sizes, however, everything is kept proportional and the same as the desktop view for consistency
		- Removed self-portrait as it wouldn't fit in seamlessly
		- Centered introduction text to fit aspect ratio contraints, given that I removed the self-portrait
	
- *Where applicable*: padding and margin elements were sized with vw, vh, etc. whereas font sizes and other atributes were sized using em and px as they typically are.

**Personal Portrait**
- I used my skills in Photoshop and Illustrator to render and vectorize a self portrait of myself to integrate seamlessly into the landing page of my website.

**Easy connect**
- In the top-right (just like my resume) are my resume, email, linkedin, and behance, (Github soon as I get some more done with it) to provide the person outlets to get to know more about me or potentially contact me if they're interested


## JavaScript Code

**Sticky Navbar with Smooth Scroll**
- As you click an icon on the navigation bar, the page will vertically scroll to the respective section, with a fading element throughout the bar.

**Scroll Activated Fade Animation**
- I didn't want everything to just be static as you scroll so I integrated a fading animation that fades out elements that slowly are out of view as you scroll down and fade back in when they're back in view as you scroll up.

**Particles.js**
- Experimented with several different shapes and modifications (color, speed, density) and settled for a blueish circles, of a couple different sizes hovering at a decent speed to not be too flashy, yet fulfil the emptiness of the white background.

## BONUS
- Saw an increase in interviews after integrating this website into my application and resume. Was also commended by recruiters (including Microsoft), co-op advisors, colleagues for my work on it.

I built this website completely from scratch to really show employers what I'm capable of and how passionate I am. I tried to create a personal brand and really showcase my passion by combining and creating as many aspects that set my website personalized and as different from others as possible.
